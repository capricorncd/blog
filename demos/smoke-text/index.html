  <p>Vite (French word for "fast", pronounced /vit/) is a new breed of frontend build tool that significantly improves the frontend development experience. It consists of two major parts:</p>
  <p>A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).</p>
  <p>A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.</p>
  <p>In addition, Vite is highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.</p>
